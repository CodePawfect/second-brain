### Why TLS?
TLS (Transport Layer Security) sits on top of TCP and does:
- encrypt data, so it's unreadable by attackers
- ensures the data wasn't altered in transit
- verifies the identity of the other party

## Questions

What is the purpose of TLS?::TLS (Transport Layer Security) encryptes data, ensures the data wasnt tampered and verifies the identity of the other party.

What are TLS Certificates?::TLS certificates are used to establish trust between the client and server. They contain information about the identity of the server and are signed by a trusted third party (a Certificate Authority) to verify their authenticity.

What happens during the TLS Handshake?::During the TLS handshake, the client and server exchange cryptographic information to authenticate each other, agree on encryption algorithms, and securely establish shared keys used to encrypt the communication.
