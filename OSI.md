**Layer 7 / Application:**  
Provides network services directly to end-user applications, including data input and output for processes like email, file transfer, or web browsing.

**Layer 6 / Presentation:**  
Performs conversion of system-dependent data into a standardized format (e.g., JSON, ASCII, UTF-8), and may also handle encryption and compression.

**Layer 5 / Session:**  
Manages communication sessions between devices, including establishing, maintaining, and terminating connections.

**Layer 4 / Transport:**  
Ensures end-to-end data delivery, assigns data to the correct application, and handles sequencing, error detection, and flow control (e.g., TCP, UDP, QUIC).

**Layer 3 / Network:**  
Handles logical addressing and routing of data packets across networks (e.g., using IP).

**Layer 2 / Data Link:**  
Segments packets into frames, manages physical addressing (e.g., MAC addresses), and adds checksums for error detection.

**Layer 1 / Physical:**  
Transmits raw bits over a physical medium by converting digital data into electrical, optical, or radio signals.
